# How to Use:

#1 After building the project, go into the bin folder, find MasterBuilder.exe file.

#2 Copy and paste the exe into any unity project's source folder, make sure there is 
	also an AutoBuild.cmd inside that unity project source folder(can just use the one I submited for A2).

#3 Make sure both cmd and exe are in the source folder, then you can run the MasterBuilder.exe.

#4 It will ask you to input the password, the correct password is "GGEZ". After entering the correct password,

#5 It will take you to a new page where you can set up a timer, once you set up the timer and click start,
the application will starts building the unity project every "the time you set" until  you close the window or hit
the reset button.
